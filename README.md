# PicoBlaze Simulator for Android
This is my attempt to modify the [PicoBlaze Simulator in JavaScript](https://flatassembler.github.io/PicoBlaze/PicoBlaze.html), so that it can be run on Android without an Internet connection. This version is written in a combination of JavaScript and Java, and uses the V8 JavaScript engine built into Android. Right now, it is in very early stages of development.
